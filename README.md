# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
A chief data scientist for a city school district has given me the following tasks to help the school board with making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities.

1. A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format.
2. An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format.
3. Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
      -Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
      -The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
      -The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
      -School performance based on the budget per student
      -School performance based on the school size 
      -School performance based on the type of school.

## Challenge Summary
With this script and a few modifications we can do an audit on a grander scale (national election) by adding in more candidates to the pool or a more in depth way by finding the results of each candidate in each county of a state. With modifications we can dive deep and see how a particular candidate did in a county like Jefferson County or in a different county of a different state if we expand analysis to a national level.
